TrafficSim
=======

Pedestrian traffic simulation with different maps and
predefined simulations like the famous christmas fair simulation.

Getting started
---------------

To run the simulation you need to have at least `Python 3.4` installed. The application
also requires `numpy` and `matplotlib`. You can use `pip` to
resolve the dependencies:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`.



Usage - In a Nutshell
-----

To start a simulation you need to run `simulation.py` with an appropriate simulation file.
Predefined simulations can be found in the `simulations` folder.

`./simulation.py simulations/simple.sim`
